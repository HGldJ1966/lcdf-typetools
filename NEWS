LCDF Typetools NEWS

Version 0.15   4.Jul.2003

* otftotfm: Bug fix: Don't multiply apply substitutions and kerns from the
  same lookup.

* otftotfm: Supports simple left-contextual substitutions, necessary for
  ExPontoPro's 'calt' (Contextual Alternates) feature.


Version 0.14   2.Jul.2003

* otftotfm: Add '-L/--letterspacing' option at Bruce D'Arcus's request.

* otftotfm: Hypothetically supports the contextual substitutions necessary
  for the 'init' (Initial Forms) feature.

* otftotfm: When you make a virtual font named "foo", remove any entries
  for "foo" from VENDOR.map.


Version 0.13   27.Jun.2003

* --without-kpathsea works. Problem reported by Adam Lindsay.


Version 0.12   27.Jun.2003

* otftotfm: Better error messages when directories cannot be found.
  Reported by Bruce D'Arcus.


Version 0.11   26.Jun.2003

* otftotfm: Handles the contextual substitutions necessary for 'cswh'
  (Contextual Swash) and 'fina' (Terminal Forms) features.


Version 0.10   26.Jun.2003

* otftotfm: Update ls-R files for new encodings.


Version 0.9   25.Jun.2003

* otftotfm: psfonts.map lines contain the file name only (no directories).
  Requested by Norbert Preining.

* otftotfm: Properly report errors when encoding files can't be found.

* Fix kpathsea searching and dependency problems reported by Bruce D'Arcus
  and Claire Connelly, among others.

* Fix templates to allow compilation with GCC 2.95.


Version 0.8   23.Jun.2003

* otftopl has been renamed to otftotfm. The new program takes different
  options. Automatic mode is particularly different, and TFM output is now
  the default.

* otftotfm: Automatic mode now sticks files into a TeX Directory Structure
  hierarchy. This works well with many TeX installations. It also
  automatically translates OpenType fonts into Type 1 PostScript with
  cfftot1 (unless you configure with --disable-cfftot1), and modifies a
  psfonts.map file for each font. See the manual page for more information.

* otftotfm: Generates virtual fonts when required to support glyph
  positioning features. ("-f cpsp" is one example.)

* otftotfm: Warns when a feature could not be completely implemented.

* otftotfm: Add --verbose and --no-create options, among others
  (--no-virtual, --map-file, --vendor, --typeface, --no-type1...).

* otftotfm: Encoding files are now named "a_SIGNATURE.enc", not
  "auto_SIGNATURE.enc".

* The configure script now searches for the kpathsea library, since
  otftotfm's automatic mode depends on kpathsea. Provide
  '--without-kpathsea' to disable it.


Version 0.7   13.Jun.2003

* cfftot1: Fix bug to handle MinionPro-Italic without crashing.


Version 0.6   12.Jun.2003

* cfftot1: Fix definitions of Subrs entries 1 and 2; now fonts with flex
  hints will work.

* cfftot1: Reduce noise generated by fonts with flex hints.

* cfftot1: Generates valid character strings for characters whose first
  point is at the origin. (Previously, such charstrings wouldn't begin with
  a "moveto".)

* otftopl: Support simple context substitutions and chained context
  substitutions. Required to support ACaslonPro-Italic's "swsh" feature.
  Reported by Adam Lindsay <atl@comp.lancs.ac.uk>.

* otftopl: Prefer '--query-features' and '--query-scripts' to
  '--print-features' and '--print-scripts'.

* otftopl: Better warnings and error messages for bad LIGKERN/UNICODING
  commands in encoding files, and when there isn't enough room in an
  encoding for ligature glyphs.

* t1lint: Reads stdin if no filenames supplied on the command line.


Version 0.5   5.Jun.2003

* Template reorganization so the typetools compile with GCC 3.3.


Version 0.4   3.Jun.2003

* otftopl: Added --slant and --extend options.

* otftopl's generated encodings have slightly different form, and are thus
  friendlier to ps2pk's bad parser.


Version 0.3   3.Jun.2003

* Fixed bug: cfftot1 produced invalid results for fonts with encodings
  other than StandardEncoding, due to a misbehavior in the way Type 1 fonts
  were stored. Reported by Vladimir Volovich <vvv@vsu.ru>.


Version 0.2   3.Jun.2003

* Fix CFF parsing bugs and configure errors reported by Vladimir Volovich
  <vvv@vsu.ru>.


Version 0.1   2.Jun.2003

* Initial release.
