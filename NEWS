Version 0.8   23.Jun.2003

* otftopl has been renamed to otftotfm. The new program takes different
  options; automatic mode is particularly different.

* otftotfm:


Version 0.7   13.Jun.2003

* cfftot1: Fix bug to handle MinionPro-Italic without crashing.


Version 0.6   12.Jun.2003

* cfftot1: Fix definitions of Subrs entries 1 and 2; now fonts with flex
  hints will work.

* cfftot1: Reduce noise generated by fonts with flex hints.

* cfftot1: Generates valid character strings for characters whose first
  point is at the origin. (Previously, such charstrings wouldn't begin with
  a "moveto".)

* otftopl: Support simple context substitutions and chained context
  substitutions. Required to support ACaslonPro-Italic's "swsh" feature.
  Reported by Adam Lindsay <atl@comp.lancs.ac.uk>.

* otftopl: Prefer '--query-features' and '--query-scripts' to
  '--print-features' and '--print-scripts'.

* otftopl: Better warnings and error messages for bad LIGKERN/UNICODING
  commands in encoding files, and when there isn't enough room in an
  encoding for ligature glyphs.

* t1lint: Reads stdin if no filenames supplied on the command line.


Version 0.5   5.Jun.2003

* Template reorganization so the typetools compile with GCC 3.3.


Version 0.4   3.Jun.2003

* otftopl: Added --slant and --extend options.

* otftopl's generated encodings have slightly different form, and are thus
  friendlier to ps2pk's bad parser.


Version 0.3   3.Jun.2003

* Fixed bug: cfftot1 produced invalid results for fonts with encodings
  other than StandardEncoding, due to a misbehavior in the way Type 1 fonts
  were stored. Reported by Vladimir Volovich <vvv@vsu.ru>.


Version 0.2   3.Jun.2003

* Fix CFF parsing bugs and configure errors reported by Vladimir Volovich
  <vvv@vsu.ru>.


Version 0.1   2.Jun.2003

* Initial release.
