.SH NAME
otftotfm \- create TeX font metrics from PostScript OpenType fonts
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B otftotfm
\%[\fB-a\fR]
\%[\fBoptions\fR]
\%\fIotffile\fR [\fIfontname\fR]
'
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR Otftotfm
creates TeX font metrics and a 
.M dvips 1 -like
encoding file that correspond, as far as possible, to a PostScript-flavored
OpenType font. The generated files are written into the current directory,
or, with the
.B \-a 
option, into a TeX Directory Structure.
.LP
OpenType fonts come with configurable knobs called
.IR features .
Turning on the "small capitals" feature, for example, replaces lower-case
letter glyphs with the corresponding small capitals. Other features control
the spacing of capital letters, whether numbers are lining or old-style,
and so forth. (You can check the features a font supports using otftotfm's
.B \-\-query\-features
option.)
.LP
OpenType features can be more complex than TeX can handle, but many
features useful for Western scripts (Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic, for
example) are supported by TeX, including:
.IP * 3
Glyph substitutions, such as replacing 'a' with small caps 
.SM 'A'.
.IP * 3
Pair kerns, such as moving 'AV' closer together.
.IP * 3
Ligatures, such as replacing 'f' and 'i' with an integrated 'fi'
glyph.
.IP * 3
Simple glyph positionings, such as adding extra space on either side of 'W'.
.LP
Otftotfm reads an OpenType font, turns on any font features you choose, and
generates font metrics and a dvips encoding file that, together, implement
as much of those features as possible. By default otftotfm creates TFM and
VF files using the
.M pltotf 1
and
.M vptovf 1
programs, but supply the
.B \-\-pl
option and it will generate human-readable PL and VPL files.
'
.SS Common features
.PP
Even "default" ligatures and pair kerns are generally optional in OpenType
fonts, so you'll generally provide the
.BR \-f kern
and 
.BR \-f liga
options to turn them on. Other features you may be interested in include
.BR \-f cpsp,
for capital spacing;
.BR \-f dlig,
for optional ligatures;
.BR \-f lnum,
.BR \-f onum,
.BR \-f "pnum, and"
.BR \-f tnum,
to control digit glyphs;
.BR \-f smcp,
for small capitals;
and
.BR \-f swsh,
for swash variants. See the OPENTYPE FEATURES section below for more
information on these and other features.
'
.SS Automatic mode
.PP
Automatic mode, triggered by the
.BR \-a / \-\-automatic
option, is the easiest way to use otftotfm. In automatic mode, otftotfm
will install the font metrics and encoding files where TeX can find them,
and additionally install a Type 1 font and mapping for dvips. This requires
a TeX installation that follows the TeX Directory Structure standard
(http://www.tug.org/tds/), such as most Unix TeX installations.
'
.PP
Simple instructions for web2c-based installations: First, create a
.I $HOME/texmf
directory, if you don't have one already. Add a
.I $HOME/texmf/dvips
subdirectory, and create a file
.I $HOME/texmf/dvips/config.ps
containing the like "p +lcdftools.map" (or add that line to your existing
.I config.ps
file); this will help
.M dvips 1
find your new fonts. Now, after running "otftotfm
.B \-a
.IR file .otf
.IR fontname \&",
you will immediately be able to refer to the font in TeX using the
.I fontname
you supplied to otftotfm. (Of course, you will have to do more work to make
the font conveniently accessible from LaTeX or ConTeXt.)
'
.PP
In automatic mode, otftotfm first searches your $TEXMF path for a writable
directory. Often this will be your "$HOME/texmf" directory; you might want
to create this directory now. It then installs files under that directory
tree. Specifically, it places files in type-specific subdirectories,
as follows:
'
.TS
l	l	l	.
\fBFile type\fR	\fBDirectory\fR	\fBFilename\fR
TFM	TEXMF/fonts/tfm/\fIvendor\fR/\fItypeface\fR/	\fIfontname\fR[--base].tfm

psfonts.map	TEXMF/dvips/	\fIvendor\fR.map
.TE
.PP
"TEXMF" stands for the writable $TEXMF directory. \fIFontname\fR is the
font name supplied as otftotfm's second argument, and \fIPSfontname\fR is
the PostScript name of the input font. The \fIvendor\fR and \fItypeface\fR
strings are required by TDS; they default to "lcdftools" and the font's
family name, respectively, but see the
.B \-\-vendor
and
.B \-\-typeface
options below. \fISignature\fR is an opaque 6-character encoding signature.
.PP
You can override these directories with environment variables and options
as follows. Options take precedence over environment variables.

With long options, you need type only as many characters as will make the
option unique.
.SS Font feature options
.PD 0
.TP 5
.BI \-s " script\fR[.\fIlang\fR], " \-\-script= "script\fR[.\fIlang\fR]"
Apply features suitable to the script system
.I script
and language system
.IR lang .
Scripts and language systems are two-to-four-letter names assigned by
Microsoft and Adobe. Examples include "latn" (Latin script), "grek" (Greek
script), and "yi.YIC" (Yi script with classic characters). If
.I lang
is not specified, otftotfm will use the default language system for that
script. You can give this option multiple times. Run "otftotfm
\-\-query\-scripts \fIfont\fR" to see the list of scripts and languages a
font supports. Defaults to "latn".
'
.Sp
.TP 5
.BI \-f " feature\fR, " \-\-feature= "feature"
Activate the feature named
.IR feature .
Features are four-letter names assigned by Microsoft and Adobe; they are
meant to correspond to font behaviors, such as kerning or small-capitals.
Examples include "liga" (default ligatures), "dlig" (discretionary
ligatures), "kern" (kerning), and "c2sc" (replacing capitals with small
capitals). Give this option multiple times to apply multiple features. Run
"otftotfm \-\-query\-features [--script options] \fIfont\fR" to see the list
of features a font supports for the specified collection of scripts.
Defaults to any features required by the selected scripts.

.TP 5
.BI \-e " encoding\fR, " \-\-encoding= encoding
Selects the
.M dvips 1
encoding used as a starting point. Otftotfm will search for
.IR encoding [.enc]
the same way that
.B dvips
would, so you may not need to give a full pathname. Defaults to the font's
encoding. See ENCODINGS, below, for more information on how otftotfm uses
encodings.
'
.Sp
.TP 5
.BI \-\-literal\-encoding= encoding
Selects the

.SH ENCODINGS
.PP
Otftotfm uses its input encodings by translating glyph names into Unicode
code points. For example, if an input encoding has "/dotlessi" at position
10, then otftotfm detects that the user wants to encode Unicode character
U+0131 LATIN SMALL LETTER DOTLESS I at position 10. The output encoding
will use whatever glyph the font suggests for that code point, given the
collection of features you chose.
.PP
You can control this process with "UNICODING" comments in the input
encoding file. UNICODING comments have the following format:
.nf
  % UNICODING \fIglyph\fR =: \fIchoice1\fR [\fIchoice2\fR ...] ;
.fi
\fIGlyph\fR and the
.IR choice s
are PostScript glyph names. This comment tells otftotfm that the glyph named
.I glyph 
translates into the first Unicode code point in the
.I choice
list that the font supports. For example, this UNICODING:
.nf
  % UNICODING Delta =: Deltagreek Delta ;
.fi
tells otftotfm that U+0394 GREEK CAPITAL LETTER DELTA should be preferred to
U+2206 INCREMENT as an encoding for "/Delta". You can also map a glyph to
nothing to remove that glyph from the input encoding; for instance:
.nf
  % UNICODING ff =: ; fi =: ; fl =: ; ffi =: ; ffl =: ;
.fi
As with LIGKERN comments, you can specify multiple UNICODINGs per line;
separate them with spaced semicolons.
.PP
Glyphs used by ligatures are added to the encoding in any empty spaces,
using their original locations when possible.
.PP
Ligatures can be added and kerns inhibited by LIGKERN comments in the
encoding, as in
.M afm2tfm 1 .
Otftotfm also supports extended syntax for inhibiting ligatures.
This command:
.nf
  % LIGKERN \fIglyph1\fR {L} \fIglyph2\fR ;
.fi
inhibits any ligature between
.I glyph1
and
.IR glyph2 .
"{K}", like "{}", inhibits kerns only, and "{LK}" and "{KL}" inhibit both
ligatures and kerns. Otftotfm parses "% LIGKERNX" comments as well as "%
LIGKERN" comments; it's probably better to put the extended commands in
LIGKERNX blocks, since that avoids confusing
.M afm2tfm 1 .
'
.SH "OPENTYPE FEATURES"
.LP
This section lists features common to Western OpenType fonts and describes
how otftotfm handles them for common fonts.
.Sp
.PD 0
.TP 5
.IR aalt ", Access All Alternates"
Lets the user choose between all available alternate forms for a character.
This includes things like superscript and subscript variants, as well as
different styles (swash, for example). This is not likely useful for TeX,
since a TeX user can't interactively choose a given alternate form. Not
well supported. See also
.IR salt .
.TP 5
.IR c2sc ", Small Capitals From Capitals"
Replaces capital letters with small capitals: a sort of converse of the
more conventional
.I smcp
feature, which replaces lower-case letters with small capitals. Supported.
.TP 5
.IR case ", Case-Sensitive Forms"
Shifts punctuation marks up to a position that works well with
all-capital-letter sequences. For example, the hyphen character, which
generally centers vertically on the x-height, is raised up to center
vertically on a capital letter. Also replaces text figures with lining
figures, and accent marks with forms more appropriate for capitals.
Supported.
.TP 5
.IR cpsp ", Capital Spacing"
Adds a bit of space on either side of each capital letter. Supported.
(However, the OpenType tag registry suggests that
.I cpsp
be on by default, but applying to all-caps text only; TeX cannot easily
implement that contextual intelligence.)
.TP 5
.IR cswh ", Contextual Swash"
Lets the user choose between context-appropriate swash forms for each
character. For example, in the words "Ab AC", the first "A" might be
translated to a swash form, while the second might not. There may be more
than one choice for a given letter, in which case the user should be able
to select among them. TeX can't support complex contextual swashes, or
alternate selection, but otftotfm supports some fonts quite well. The input
encoding should have lots of empty space for swash variants, and it should
specify a boundary character.
.TP 5
.IR dlig ", Discretionary Ligatures"
Activates uncommon ligatures, such as "c_t", "s_p", and "s_t". Supported.
.TP 5
.IR dnom ", Denominators"
Replaces digits and some punctuation marks with smaller forms sitting on
the baseline, intended for fraction denominators. Supported, but not
usually useful.
.TP 5
.IR fina ", Terminal Forms"
Substitutes appropriate forms for letters occurring at the ends of words.
This feature doesn't select swash variants; it's intended for normal use,
and the specification recommends that it be on by default. Partially
supported: TeX will only treat spaces as the ends of words, where a correct
implementation would probably include punctuation too. See
.IR cswh
for selecting swash variants active at the ends of words.
.TP 5
.IR frac ", Fractions"
Replaces sequences like "1/2" with nice-looking fractions. The contextual
lookup is too hard for TeX; not supported.
.TP 5
.IR hist ", Historical Forms"
Replaces characters with historical variants. Usually, this means at least
translating regular "s" to long "s". Supported.
.TP 5
.IR kern ", Kerning"
Adjusts the space between characters (pair kerning). Generally supported,
and you should probably turn it on.
.TP 5
.IR liga ", Standard Ligatures"
Activates common ligatures, such as "f_f", "f_i", "f_f_j", and (in some
Adobe fonts) "T_h". Generally supported, and you should probably turn it
on.
.TP 5
.IR lnum ", Lining Figures"
Uses lining figures, the set of digits that are all about as high as
capital letters. Supported. See also
.IR pnum
and
.IR tnum.
.TP 5
.IR numr ", Numerators"
Replaces digits and some punctuation marks with smaller, raised forms
intended for fraction numerators. Supported, but not usually useful.
.TP 5
.IR onum ", Oldstyle Figures"
Uses old-style, or text, figures, the set of digits that have ascenders and
descenders like lower-case letters. Supported. See also
.IR pnum
and
.IR tnum.
.TP 5
.IR ordn ", Ordinals"
Designed for Spanish and French. Replaces ordinal numbers, such as "2.o",
with forms where the "o" is raised, and replaces the sequence "No" with an
integrated glyph. This contextual intelligence is too hard for TeX; not
supported.
.TP 5
.IR ornm ", Ornaments"
Replaces some alphabetic characters in the font with ornaments, and links
the bullet character to a set of all bullet-like ornaments, from which the
user can choose. Partially supported: TeX can handle alphabetic
substitutions, but not bullet choice.
.TP 5
.IR pnum ", Proportional Figures"
Digits will have different widths (compare
.IR tnum ).
Supported. See also
.IR lnum
and
.IR onum.
.TP 5
.IR salt ", Stylistic Alternates"
Lets the user choose between stylistic alternate forms for a character.
Partially supported: A TeX user can't interactively choose a given
alternate form, so otftotfm takes the first option whenever there's more
than one choice. See also
.IR aalt ;
.IR salt
is generally more useful than
.IR aalt
for TeX, since it refers exclusively to stylistic alternates.
.TP 5
.IR sinf ", Scientific Inferiors"
Replaces digits and some punctuation marks with smaller, lowered forms
intended for subscripts. Supported.
.TP 5
.IR size ", Optical Size"
This feature stores information about the range of optical sizes for which
the font was intended. There is no point in selecting it with otftotfm,
since it should not change the font's appearance in any way.
.TP 5
.IR smcp ", Small Capitals"
Replaces lower-case letters with small capitals. Supported. Compare
.IR c2sc .
.TP 5
.IR sups ", Superscript"
Replaces digits, some punctuation marks, and some lower-case letters with
smaller, raised forms intended for superscripts. Supported.
.TP 5
.IR swsh ", Swash"
Activates all swash forms for each character. There may be more than one
swash form, in which case otftotfm will pick the first one listed.
Supported, except that swash variants other than the first are
inaccessible.
.TP 5
.IR tnum ", Tabular Figures"
All digits will have the same width, so that tables and the like will align
visually (compare
.IR pnum ).
Supported. See also
.IR lnum
and
.IR onum.
.TP 5
.IR zero ", Slashed Zero"
Replaces the zero character with a slashed zero. Supported.
.PD
'
.SH "BUGS"
.LP
Presumably some context-sensitive positionings and ligatures could be
implemented with TeX's boundary character, but otftotfm doesn't do that yet.
.LP
More positionings and ligatures could be supported with the help of virtual
fonts.
