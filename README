LCDF-TYPETOOLS 0.8
==================

USAGE
-----
   The LCDF Typetools package contains several programs for manipulating
PostScript Type 1 and PostScript-flavored OpenType fonts.

   Cfftot1 translates a Compact Font Format (CFF) font, or a PostScript-
flavored OpenType font, into PostScript Type 1 format. It correctly handles
subroutines and hints. See the manual page 'cfftot1/cfftot1.1' for more
information.

   Otftopl creates TeX font metrics and encodings that correspond to a
PostScript-flavored OpenType font. It will interpret glyph positionings,
substitutions, and ligatures as far as it is able. You can say which
OpenType features should be activated. See the manual page
'otftopl/otftopl.1' for more information.

   The other two programs are preliminary and have little or no
documentation. T1lint checks a Type 1 font for correctness, and t1testpage
creates PostScript test page file for a given font file.
